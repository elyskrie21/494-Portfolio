            </div>
            <div class="pb-4">
              <p>
                Ethics is fundamental in engineering, guiding professionals in
                their actions and decisions. A "Code of Ethics" serves as a
                moral compass, providing a set of principles and values that
                engineers should uphold in their practice. This essay will
                explore the purpose of having and following a Code of Ethics,
                delve into the personal decision-making process in ethical
                situations, discuss ethical issues addressed in a class, and
                reflect on the "Virtue of Ethics" concerning a case study.

              <p>
                A "Code of Ethics" in engineering serves multiple crucial
                purposes. Firstly, it establishes ethical standards, fostering
                trust and credibility among professionals and the public. It
                outlines acceptable behavior, ensuring that engineers maintain
                integrity, professionalism, and accountability. Secondly, it
                guides engineers when they encounter complex ethical dilemmas by
                providing a reference point for ethical decision-making. For
                instance, the IEEE Code of Ethics sets forth principles such as
                "to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the
                public" and "to avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest."
                These principles help engineers navigate challenging situations
                with clarity.

            <div class="pb-4">
              <p>
                My decision-making process involves several key factors when
                faced with an ethical situation. Firstly, I assess the situation
                and identify the ethical dilemma at hand. Next, I consider the
                potential consequences of various courses of action, both in
                terms of benefits and harm. Factors such as the impact on family
                members and friends, societal implications, and legal
                obligations are considered. Furthermore, I evaluate the
                principles I have been taught by my parents and other aspects of
                my life relevant to the situation, seeking guidance from
                established ethical norms. Additionally, I engage in ethical
                discussions with friends, family, and co-workers, seeking
                diverse perspectives to inform my decisions. Ultimately, my
                decision is based on a balance of these considerations, striving
                to uphold the highest ethical standards.

                During our ethics in engineering class, we delved into various
                topics, including environmental responsibility, safety concerns,
                professional integrity, and conflicts of interest. We gained
                valuable insight into the ethical dilemmas engineers may
                encounter in their professional practice by examining real-world
                case studies.

                The ethical considerations introduced in the class were both
                similar and different from my ethics. They were similar in that
                they emphasized the importance of safety, public welfare, and
                integrity, aligning with principles within an established code
                of ethics (While the class focused on the IEEE Code of Ethics, I
                used my “own” form of code of ethics). However, the class
                discussions often introduced nuances and complexities specific
                to engineering practice, challenging me to think critically
                about applying ethical principles. While my ethics provided a
                solid foundation, the class discussions enriched my
                understanding of the ethical dimensions unique to the
                engineering profession.

                In our class, reaching a consensus on the "most ethical"
                decision could be challenging, as ethical dilemmas often involve
                multiple perspectives and trade-offs. However, the discussions
                were invaluable in highlighting the importance of ethical
                deliberation and the need to consider diverse viewpoints. While
                consensus was only sometimes achieved, the process of ethical
                discourse was informative and encouraged critical thinking.

                In the context of the Grimshaw case, three virtues from the
                "Virtue of Ethics" stand out as particularly relevant:
              </p>
              <ol class="list-decimal px-8">
                <li>
                  <strong>Integrity</strong>: Integrity is essential because it
                  involves being truthful and transparent about product safety
                  issues. In the Grimshaw case, Ford's lack of transparency
                  regarding Pinto’s safety concerns was a significant ethical
                  failing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Responsibility:</strong> Responsibility is closely
                  tied to ensuring the safety of the products engineer’s design
                  and manufacture. Engineers have a moral obligation to
                  prioritize public safety over profit, which was a key issue in
                  the Grimshaw case.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Honesty:</strong> Honesty is vital in acknowledging
                  and addressing safety issues honestly, both within the
                  organization and with the public. Ford's failure to be honest
                  about Pinto’s safety issues had serious ethical consequences.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="pb-4">
              <p>
                In the "Virtue of Ethics," the other virtues are important in
                different situations, but they are especially relevant to the
                Grimshaw case because they relate directly to product safety and
                corporate responsibility. In addition to the ethical virtues
                mentioned in the "Virtue of Ethics," courage and fairness also
                apply to this case study. It required courage to stand up for
                what is just when facing a major corporation, and fairness was
                crucial in making decisions that didn't overly favor one party
                while neglecting the rights and interests of others.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="pb-4">
              <p>
                Engineering professionals navigate a complex landscape of
                ethical dilemmas. A "Code of Ethics" provides guidance and
                principles, while personal decision-making processes involve
                assessing dilemmas, considering consequences, and seeking
                guidance from established norms. Ethical issues discussed in
                class enhance our understanding of professional ethics, even as
                they introduce unique perspectives and complexities. The "Virtue
                of Ethics" framework offers valuable insights into the virtues
                that engineers should embody, with integrity, responsibility,
                and honesty particularly relevant to our case study. Ethical
                reflection and discourse remain essential for engineers to
                uphold the highest ethical standards and make responsible
                decisions that prioritize the well-being of society and the
                profession.

              General Education Reflection – Iowa State University
            </h1>

            <p class="pb-4">
              Throughout my time at Iowa State University, the general education
              courses I’ve taken have significantly shaped the way I think,
              communicate, and engage with problems—especially those I may
              encounter as an engineer. Classes like LIB160, ARCH321, ENGL150,
              and ENGL250 have broadened my perspective beyond technical
              knowledge, offering valuable tools for research, communication,
              and understanding the societal context in which engineering
              solutions exist.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-4">
              <strong>LIB160</strong> was my first step into learning how to
              access and evaluate credible information—a critical skill in both
              academic and professional settings. This course taught me how to
              efficiently use library databases, assess sources for reliability,
              and cite them appropriately. These research skills are fundamental
              to solving engineering problems, where backing up technical
              decisions with reliable data can be crucial. Whether I’m writing a
              report or validating a proposed design, the ability to locate and
              assess supporting information ensures my work is thorough and
              informed.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-4">
              In <strong>ARCH321</strong>, the History of the American City, I
              explored how urban environments have developed and changed over
              time. This class gave me a better understanding of the social,
              environmental, and economic factors that influence city planning
              and infrastructure. By studying the evolution of American cities,
              I now have a greater appreciation for how engineering
              decisions—such as building design, transportation systems, and
              zoning—impact communities long-term. This historical insight is
              invaluable when thinking about sustainable and inclusive solutions
              to contemporary issues like climate change and urban sprawl.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-4">
              <strong>ENGL150</strong> helped me develop critical thinking and
              argumentative writing skills. Through essays, peer reviews, and
              class discussions, I learned how to construct well-reasoned
              arguments and communicate my ideas clearly. As an engineering
              student, this has translated directly into how I approach
              problems: identifying key issues, considering different
              perspectives, and presenting logical solutions. Strong
              communication is essential in engineering teams, and ENGL150 laid
              the groundwork for articulating technical and ethical concerns
              with clarity.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-4">
              Building on that foundation, <strong>ENGL250</strong> focused on
              technical communication—an area directly aligned with engineering.
              In this course, I learned how to write formal reports, create
              professional documents, and adapt language for various audiences.
              Whether it’s a design proposal or an instruction manual, technical
              communication is a daily part of engineering practice. ENGL250
              taught me how to tailor my writing to both technical and
              non-technical readers, ensuring my ideas are understood by
              stakeholders at all levels.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-4">
              Collectively, these general education courses have not only
              enriched my education but also equipped me to tackle complex
              engineering challenges. They’ve helped me think critically,
              communicate effectively, and consider the broader social and
              environmental context of the work I’ll do. For example, as climate
              change continues to affect communities globally, my ability to
              research solutions, understand historical trends, and communicate
              designs clearly will be essential in creating sustainable
              infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-4">
              In conclusion, general education at Iowa State has provided me
              with a strong, interdisciplinary foundation that complements my
              technical training. By integrating research skills, historical
              awareness, critical thinking, and communication, I am better
              prepared to face real-world engineering problems with a holistic
              approach.
