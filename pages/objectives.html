        Career Objectives
      </h1>

      <section class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-2xl p-8 space-y-6">
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          As I look toward my professional future, I envision a career that
          blends creativity, impact, and technical depth. I’m not just
          interested in writing code—I’m driven to build systems that make real
          lives easier, more connected, and more equitable. I believe the best
          engineering comes from understanding people just as much as
          understanding tools, and I want to be part of solving problems that
          matter.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          My near-term goal is to work on a team that values thoughtful
          architecture, clean code, and user-first thinking. I want to continue
          developing full-stack applications and infrastructure with modern
          tools like AWS, React, and Python—tools I've already grown confident
          in through academic and internship experiences. I'm particularly
          interested in scalable cloud services, intelligent interfaces, and
          applications that integrate machine learning to enhance user
          experience.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Beyond the tech stack, I’m drawn to environments that emphasize
          collaboration, mentorship, and innovation. I hope to earn the trust
          and experience needed to move into a solutions architect or technical
          lead position where I can influence not just what we build, but how
          and why we build it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Long-term, I aim to contribute to impactful platforms—especially in
          areas like education, sustainable living, and digital equity. Whether
          it's helping a startup scale or contributing to open-source
          initiatives, I want to leave behind tools that uplift and empower. I
          also aspire to mentor younger engineers, helping others navigate this
          field with the same support and enthusiasm I’ve been fortunate to
          receive.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          At the heart of it all, my objective is simple: to grow into a builder
          who writes software with purpose, leads with empathy, and never stops
          learning.
