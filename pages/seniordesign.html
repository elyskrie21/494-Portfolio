          <p class="mb-2">
            Our senior design project, <strong>dripdrop</strong>, is a full-stack social media platform that enables users to share their outfits and monetize their style through affiliate marketing. The platform democratizes fashion influence by allowing users of any following size to earn rewards by posting outfits. AI-generated outfit suggestions and price comparison tools make fashion more accessible and affordable. The system includes a web platform and a cross-platform mobile application, supported by a cloud-based backend infrastructure using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
          </p>
          <p>
            Core features include user authentication, posting, liking, following other users, and receiving AI-generated clothing recommendations with links to more affordable options. The application leverages AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Aurora MySQL, S3 buckets for image storage, and Amazon SageMaker for AI processing. The frontend is built with React and React Native (via Expo), and infrastructure is deployed using the AWS CDK.

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">My Role</h2>
          <p>
            As one of the primary developers on the project, I was responsible for backend architecture and infrastructure provisioning using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). I implemented several Lambda functions, managed data interactions with the Aurora MySQL database, and supported frontend integration through well-documented REST API endpoints. I also contributed to the CI/CD pipeline setup and ensured secure IAM role assignments and Secrets Manager configurations. On the frontend, I assisted in building key components for user interaction using React and React Native.

          <p class="mb-2">
            My work on dripdrop played a key role in ensuring the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of our application infrastructure. I led the setup of AWS CDK stacks, enabling consistent infrastructure deployment and updates across environments. By building secure and modular Lambda functions and optimizing database interactions through RDS Proxy and Secrets Manager, I helped ensure a responsive and secure backend architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also contributed to user-facing functionality by developing API endpoints that supported dynamic content on the frontend. My efforts helped bring AI integration and affiliate functionality to life by enabling communication between the app and external services. In doing so, I not only strengthened the technical foundation of the platform, but also helped drive our mission to make fashion accessibility and social monetization available to everyone.
